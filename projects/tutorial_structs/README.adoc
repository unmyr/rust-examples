=== Create
* https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch05-02-example-structs.html[An Example Program Using Structs - The Rust Programming Language^]

. Set up a new project, and go to the projects directory.
+
[source,console]
----
$ cargo new tutorial_structs
     Created binary (application) `tutorial_structs` package
$ cd tutorial_structs
----

. open src/main.rs and replace its code with the following code that wonâ€™t compile just yet
+
[source,rust]
----
fn main() {
    let width1 = 30;
    let height1 = 50;

    println!(
        "The area of the rectangle is {} square pixels.",
        area(width1, height1)
    );
}

fn area(width: u32, height: u32) -> u32 {
    width * height
}
----

. Run `cargo run` command
+
[source,console]
----
$ cargo run
----

=== Refactoring with Tuples

[source,rust]
.src/main.rs
----
fn main() {
    let rect1 = (30, 50);

    println!(
        "The area of the rectangle is {} square pixels.",
        area(rect1)
    );
}

fn area(dimensions: (u32, u32)) -> u32 {
    dimensions.0 * dimensions.1
}
----

=== Refactoring with Structs: Adding More Meaning
[source,rust]
.src/main.rs
----
struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

fn main() {
    let rect1 = Rectangle {
        width: 30,
        height: 50,
    };

    println!(
        "The area of the rectangle is {} square pixels.",
        area(&rect1)
    );
}

fn area(rectangle: &Rectangle) -> u32 {
    rectangle.width * rectangle.height
}
