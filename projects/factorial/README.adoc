=== Create

. Letâ€™s create a new library project called `factorial`
+
[source,console]
----
$ cargo new factorial --lib
     Created library `factorial` package
$ cd factorial/
----
+
[source,rust]
.The contents of the src/lib.rs file
----
pub fn factorial_recursive_if_else(n: u32) -> u32 {
    if n < 2 {
        1
    } else {
        n * factorial_recursive_if_else(n - 1)
    }
}

...
----

. The cargo test command runs all tests in our project.
