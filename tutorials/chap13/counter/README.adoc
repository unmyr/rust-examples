=== Create

. Letâ€™s create a new library project called `counter`
+
[source,console]
----
$ cargo new --lib counter
     Created library `counter` package
$ cd counter/
----
+
[source,rust]
.The contents of the src/lib.rs file
----
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    #[test]
    fn it_works() {
        assert_eq!(2 + 2, 4);
    }
}
----

. The cargo test command runs all tests in our project.
+
[source,console]

$ cargo test
